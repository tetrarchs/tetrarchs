  <h2>Caller ID</h2>
  <h3>What is it?</h3>
  <p>In the UK, Caller ID is an optional service (BT charge &pound;3.50/qtr as of 2004) to enable
  the caller's phone number to be displayed on the receiving phone before the call
  is answered. My calls go via <a href="http://www.justdialsaver.com/" style="color:#CC99FF">Just Dial</a>
  but as my line rental is still through BT I still get the standard Caller ID service.
   Theoretically there is no reason why this Caller ID data cannot be made available to
  your personal computer to log calls or act as an answering machine.</p>
  <h3>Backgound</h3>
  <p>There are few modems available in Britain that claim to handle Caller ID.  Manufacturers
  are hesitant to explicitly state that their product will work in the UK but a model
  that claims to have <b>Bell 202</b> (some cable companies use this) <b><i>and</i></b> <b>V.23</b> (BT standard)
  should work.  Refer to <a href="http://www.ainslie.org.uk/callerid/cli_faq.htm#Q_6"
  style="color:#CC99FF">www.ainslie.org.uk/callerid/</a> for a detailed breakdown.</p>
  <p>As I have a neat office setup, I thought it would be great to be able to use the PC
  to log incoming and outgoing business calls and Caller ID would be perfect. I have
  Pipex broadband so my modem is not used for anything but the odd fax a couple of
  times a year.</p>
  
  <p>Most telephony applications that log Caller ID and can act as an answering machine are
  available for trial download and I spent a week playing around with a few on my 
  non-Caller ID modem just to make sure their functionality seemed okay.</p>
  
  <p><a href="http://www.ainslie.org.uk/callerid/tel_soft.htm"
  style="color:#CC99FF">www.ainslie.org.uk/callerid/</a> 
  has an excellent list of software, in the end CallStation by <a href="http://www.imptec.com/"
  style="color:#CC99FF">www.imptec.com</a> came out as my favorite. In particular it enables
  you to have a different greeting for any user or groups of users you define, so I
  can have a jokey answering machine message for friends, a polite one for business
  callers and a neutral one for those with Caller ID withheld.</p>

  <h3>Getting a Zoom 3025C to work in Windows 2000</h3>
  
  <h4>Step 1: Catch your pigeon</h4>
  
  <p>After a bit of on-line research the <a href="http://www.zoom.com">Zoom 3025C PCI 
  internal modem</a> seemed to be a good bet as others had got it to work with 
  Caller ID in the UK.  Zoom took over Hayes and the Hayes modems seemed to have 
  a fair reputation.</p>
  
  <p>Rather than splashing out full price, particularly as I was not 100% sure it
  would work, I took my time and bought a second hand
  one on EBay for less than &pound;7.00 including postage. New these retail for 
  just under &pound;40.00.  If you are looking at
  the Zoom, make sure it is the right model as earlier models did not have full
  Caller ID. Luckily the Zoom website has fairly detailed support documentation 
  and updated drivers available.</p>
  
  <h4>Step 2: Prepare your pigeon</h4>
  
  <p>I installed the modem, used the latest downloaded drivers from the Zoom website
  and tested basic functionality.  <i>It did not work.</i></p>
  
  <p>CallStation could not receive Caller ID no matter what I did.  I spent some time
  surfing the net for solutions.</p>
  
  <p>The most revealing diagnostic tool was to use HyperTerminal (under Programs/Accessories/Communications)
  to see if Caller ID was being returned - it was! This is the sort of response I was
  getting:</p> 
  <pre>OK
RING

DATE = 0405
TIME = 1035
NMBR = 02073470079
</pre>
  <p>More surfing and reading revealed
  that the Windows 2000 TAPI (a bit of windows software that takes the modem data
  and interprets it for applications) did not behave in a standard way. I emailed
  Zoom support but they were a bit non-plussed (they were friendly however and were
  interested in my eventual solution), they suggested I contact 
  CallStation people as "The Zoom 3025-C modem is IS-101 Telephony protocol compliant".
  It turns out that the IS-101 is the TAPI standard that Windows should comply with,
  which Windows 2000 does not. So the conclusion was that the modem was okay, the
  PC application was okay and Microsoft were the problem!</p>
  
  <h4>Step 3: Cook your pigeon</h4>
  
  <p>I was ready to quit but then I found a few websites that suggested that the
  solution to this was to change the driver installation file. A bit more investigation
  showed that in the windows registry under:</p>
  <font size=1>
  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
  <br>&nbsp;SOFTWARE
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Microsoft
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Windows
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Current Version
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unimodem
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Device Specific
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zoom V.92 PCI Voice Faxmodem::Zoom Telephonics, Inc.::Zoom Telephonics, Inc.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Responses
  </font>

  <p>Were the codes that the driver uses to respond to the windows TAPI. So rather than
  hacking away at the installation file, a few commands could be added via regedit.</p>

  <p>I suggest this is only attempted by someone who is happy using regedit, but here
  are the extra <i>binary values</i> I added (right click in the regedit window, text strings must have spaces as shown):</p>

  <pre>
  "&lt;cr&gt;&lt;lf&gt;DATE = "           '93 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00'
  "&lt;cr&gt;&lt;lf&gt;NAME = "           '96 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00'
  "&lt;cr&gt;&lt;lf&gt;NMBR = "           '95 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00'
  "&lt;cr&gt;&lt;lf&gt;TIME = "           '94 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00'
  "&lt;cr&gt;&lt;lf&gt;TYPE = "           '97 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00'
  "&lt;DLE&gt;R"                    '08 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00'
  </pre>

  <p>This was the hardest part to get right.  I had to use the 
  <abbr title="Under the modem properties / diagnotics">modem log</abbr> to work
  out that BT returned <code>"TYPE"</code> that seemed to be meaningless to the driver, so
  I set to the same as MESG (after a suggestion by Zoom), and also when in voicemode 
  the modem returned <code>"&lt;DLE&gt;R"</code> rather than <code>"RING"</code>.</p>

  <p>The last part was to get the modem initialization string right in the modem properties. In the end
  I left it as <code>"+VCID=1;+FCLASS=8;"</code> which switches on Caller ID
  and puts the modem in voicemode.</p>
  
  <p>Trying to get full telephony working was a problem (the modem has no speaker phone
  but uses the sound card). Eventually in device settings under the "Unimodem Full Duplex Audio Device" 
  "Modem Wave Driver" I <i>unchecked</i> "Do not map through this device" and it seems
  to be working okay so far.</p>
  
  <h4>Step 4: Eat your pigeon</h4>
  
  <p>CallStation uses WAV files in PCM 8000Hz mono to playback greetings to callers.
  As well as recording my own, I ended up using GoldWave to edit MP3 voicemail 
  greetings I found via P2P networking (Shareaza) into the right format.</p>
  
  <p>Interestingly the <code>NAME</code> field is not always left blank by BT.
  The two examples I have are:</p>

  <PRE>
  <u>NAME</u>            <u>NUMBER</u>
  INTERNATIONAL   O       (Out of area)
  WITHHELD        P       (Private)</PRE>

  <p>I've yet to see other uses on
  my line (I believe that PAYPHONE, UNAVAILABLE and RINGBACK are also used) 
  but CallStation uses these to set the Name field in its call log.</p>
  <p><i>
  If you are very interested BT has a document available on-line called 
  <a href="http://www.sinet.bt.com/" style="color:#CC99FF">SIN 227</a>
  which defines the "Calling Line Identification Service".
  </i></p>

  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    
  <p>Phew! After about a day of ringing my own number and swapping settings back
  and forth I have a fully working Caller ID telephony system.</p>
  <p>The best extra feature has been being able to change the number of rings before
  the PC answers the call.  So callers with Caller ID withheld, get answered in
  two rings (so I can ignore all telemarketers), general calls in four, and calls from people I really should answer
  in six (like my Mum). Most people dislike leaving a message, so at least with the
  message being suitably amusing or specific to them they are more likely to leave
  a message.  The PC also announces the name or number of the person calling using
  its speech engine, so I don't even have to run to the phone to see who's calling
  to decide if I should screen or not. The only extra feature I would like to see
  is better integration with Outlook - I would love to see the call log automatically
  laid out on my diary.</p>
  <p>In conclusion, getting Caller ID to work on your system could be quite a big
  project, so be prepared and do your homework!</p>
