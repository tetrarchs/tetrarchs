<h2><font color=black>Are spellings like 'privatize' and 'organize' Americanisms?</font></h2>
<p class="q">No, not really. British spelling has always recognized the existence of variant spellings using the suffix &#8209;ize/&#8209;ise. When American spelling was standardized during the 19th century (mainly through the efforts of the great American lexicographer Noah Webster), the consistent use of &#8209;ize was one of the conventions that became established. However, since then, the &#8209;ise spellings have become more popular in Britain (and in other English-speaking countries such as Australia), perhaps partly as a reaction against the American custom. Spellings such as organisation would have struck many older British writers as rather French-looking. The Oxford English Dictionary favoured &#8209;ize, partly on the linguistic basis that the suffix derives from the Greek suffix &#8209;izo, and this was also the style of Encyclopedia Britannica (even before it was American-owned) and formerly of the Times newspaper.</p>

<p class="q">The main advantage of the modern &#8209;ise habit? Lazy spellers do not have to remember that there are several important words which cannot properly be spelt with &#8209;ize. These include words which are not formed by the addition of the &#8209;ize prefix to a stem, but by some other root which happens to end in the same syllable, such as &#8209;vise (as in televise), &#8209;cise (as in incise), and &#8209;prise (as in comprise).</p>

<p class="q">The American system resulted in the creeping of z into some other words where it did not originally belong. Writers of American English should be aware of some spellings that are regarded as incorrect in the UK, notably analyze.</p>
