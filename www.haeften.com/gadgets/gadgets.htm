   <h5>Dec 2007</h5>
		  <p class=tf>
		  <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/macmini">Apple Mac mini core duo</a></em>.
		  My new desktop after my super-duper PC kept fatally crashing (after
		  3 years of continuous running). I have upgraded the memory from 1GB
		  to 2GB and also bought a &frac12; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/terrabyte" target="_blank">terabyte</a> USB
		  drive to compensate for the somewhat measly 160GB drive included in
		  the Mac mini. The extra drive helps with running the Leopard
		  Time Machine so that I can go back in time and grab previous versions
		  of any file.
		  </p>

           <img src="science_files/Sony_HXD870.png" align=right border=0>		  
	    <h5>Dec 2006</h5>
		  <p class=tf>
		  <em>Sony HXD870</em>.
		  This came bundled with my Sony flatscreen TV. It has one digital tuner,
		  has a DVDRW, a hard disk (180GB) and can "dub"  to a DVD. Its main claim
		  to fame is that it upscales the picture for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_HD" title="Wikipedia definition" target="_blank">HD
		  compatibility</a>, this
		  seems to work pretty well and gets rid of some of the unwanted artifacts
		  you sometimes get with DVDs on a HD screen.<br>
          The end result is that we now have 3 Freeview tuners connected to the
          TV (plus one in the TV), two 180GB PVR hard disks, the DVDRW,
          the amplifier, CD player (with 5 CD changer) and the old video cassette
          recorder (with analogue tuner).

          <p class=tf> <img src="science_files/sony40w2000.png" border=0 style="float:right;">	
		  <em>Sony Bravia 40&quot; KDL-40W2000U</em>.
		  My first LCD flat screen TV (to replace the old 37&quot; CRT TV which
		  went pop after exactly 5 years). This has 2 SCART inputs and 2 HDMI
		  inputs as well as other useful inputs. Freeview tuner built in (useful
		  if you only want to switch on the TV).<br>
		  The screen is great quality and large enough so that I can enjoy the
		  picture without having to wear my glasses all the time, I can recommend
		  going for the extra couple of inches.
          </p>

		  <em><a href="http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/whisper/index.html">Humax PVR9200T</a></em>.
		  My personal video recorder. It has 160GB hard disk space, enough for
		  about 100 recordings, and was the first on the market with two digital tuners
		  so that you can record and watch another channel or make two recordings
		  at the same time or use the picture-in-picture function.
		  You can transfer recordings via a USB2 socket to 
		  a PC but it's tricky to set up. Recordings can be scheduled on a programme
		  guide. This works extremely well with freeview TV and has transformed
		  our TV watching completely as we now watch recorded TV rather than live
		  (primarily so we can skip the adverts).

		  <em><a href="http://www.lexar.com/readers/trio.html">JumpDrive Trio</a></em>.
		  Single Slot Multi-Card Reader. This takes SD, Memory Stick, Memory Stick PRO, MMC
		  and xD-Picture cards. Very useful for transferring photos from my phone 
		  when I'm out and about.

  		  <h5>Sep 2004</h5>
		  <p class=tf>
		  <em><a href="http://www.nokia.com/nokia/0,,47665,00.html">Nokia 6320</a></em>.
		  Very much a working phone but with all the high tech features you could
		  wish for.  I get this phone free from work but I've found it a boon when
		  commuting as with the addition of a 512 MB MMC memory card I can listen
		  to music as well as the in-built radio.<br>
		  The photos it takes seem okay and the camera has not significantly bulked
		  up the phone.<br>
		  Though you can play video on the phone this seems a rather weak gimmick
		  unless you are desperate to watch you favorite film played at 128x128
		  resolution. I have watched an episode of Futurama on the phone and
		  in fact cartoons are probably the best thing to play back.

  		  <h5>Mar 2004</h5>
		  <p class=tf>
		  <em><a href="http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/specs/Sony/">Sony CyberShot DSC-T1</a></em>.
		  Super little camera bought from <a href="http://www.pixmania.com">pixmania</a>
		  to take on holiday and to keep with me around town.
		  5MP and 3x optical zoom, the
		  camera is small enough to hide in the palm of your hand.  Bought a 512K
		  Sony duo memory stick to go with it which pushed up the price but could
		  come in handy if I go away for a week without a laptop to download the
		  images to.  I even tried out the video capability at a wedding, surprisingly
		  good result in a poorly lit room recording at 640x480.<br>
		  The sensor is good is poor lighting but I normally need to touch up the
		  photos in ACDSee to get best quality results. Sony do not supply a case
		  but my zip up case for my Sony Ericsson T68i fits the camera perfectly.<br>
		  Up to now I have used an Olympus 3030C but this is too bulky to carry
		  all the time on the off chance of taking photos.

		  <p class=tf>
		  <em><a href="http://www.antec.com/uk/pro_details_enclosure.php?ProdID=08139">Antec Sonata</a> PC case</em>
		  for &pound;90. As a little project I treated my PC to a new motherboard
		  (<a href="http://www.digital-daily.com/motherboard/abit-ic7-g/index03.htm">ABIT IC7-G</a>)
		  and as I would need a new power supply, I went the whole hog and
		  got a quiet PC case to go with it.  Not a project for the faint-hearted,
		  I've changed motherboards before but starting with a generic empty case
		  was a fair challenge and took a day to assemble and a week to configure
		  everything properly (not counting the time to get a replacement motherboard
		  when the first one turned up with it's main fan broken off!).<br>
		  My PC now brags 200&nbsp;GB of disk space (over 3 hard disks), a processor
		  running at 2.4&nbsp;GHz and 1&nbsp;GB of memory.  
		  The PC makes about 1/3 of the noise it used to in the old case.

		  <h5>Dec 2003</h5>
		  <p class=tf>
		  <em><a href="http://www.nad.co.uk">NAD</a> C320BEE</em> ordered from <a href="http://www.qed-uk.com">
		  QED</a> for &pound;175. A treat before Christmas of this
		  fantastic amplifier for our hifi system. My hifi is a mixed bag of 
		  equipment from different suppliers, this NAD amplifier brings them
		  together beautifully.

		  <p class=tf>
		  <em><a href="http://www.sonyericsson.com/t68i">Sony Ericsson</a> T68i</em>
		  ordered from <a href="http://www.virginmobile.com">
		  Virgin mobile</a> (my long term pay-as-you-go mobile phone account 
		  provider as they are sooo cheap)
		  with my &pound;20 current user discount, the phone cost &pound;109 and
		  came with an extra &pound;10 voucher of Virgin airtime.

		  </h5>
		  <p class=tf>
		  <em>Sony Freeview Digital TV Receiver</em> (VTX-D800U).
		  Lovely design and a neat menu system for the program guide.
		  Cheapest price I could find was on Amazon, particularly due to their
		  offer of free delivery for orders over &pound;25.

		  <h5>June 2003</h5>
		  <p class=tf>
		  <em><a href="http://www.habitat.co.uk">Habitat</a> LED clock</em>.
		  This is exactly the same clock as Professor Ryan
		  (<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/drama/crime/silentwitness/" title="Click for the BBC cult website.">Silent Witness</a>)
		  has on her desk.  I use it in the bedroom as it&acute;s a clock I can 
		  see in the dark without my glasses on!

		  <h5>Oct 2001</h5>
		   <p class=tf>
		  <em><a href="http://www.yelo.com" 
		  title="Wierd, their site seems to say nothing.">Yelo 0800</a> DVD Player</em>. 
            Some irritating niggles on usability but a useful player 
            as I can record from DVD to my VCR as macrovision protection can be 
            by-passed and the player is fully multi-region.

		  June 1999

		   <p class=tf>
		  <em><a href="http://www.palm.com">Palm V</a></em>.  
		  Reliable and useful gadget, bought for &pound;250
		    for work purposes. Over the years I have changed the default diary to
			datebk3 and the contact book to TealPhone, both offering useful
			improvements. Of great help is Word Complete a great little application
			that guesses the word you are typing in after two letters.
			The most recent palmtops offer music and better connectivity but this
			old stalwart holds my diary, contacts, to-dos, train timetable, outlook
			email and notes so I am still waiting for a really good integrated
			mobile phone as an alternative (I have used a <em>Sony Ericsson P800</em> 
			(2003) but I found it a great disappointment).

  In June 2006 I was one of the early customers to sign up for TalkTalk "free" broadband. It took
  them 3 months to migrate my account from Pipex and I ended up without any internet
  access for 3 weeks. Not a good customer experience. However it is really cheap.
  I now have a 4Mbps with free phonecalls to anywhere in Europe, Oz and the USA
  for the same price as my original 1Mbps Pipex subscription.
