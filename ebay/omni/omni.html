              <h4>References to OMNI magazine in popular culture</h4>
              <ul type=square style="color:darkblue;font-size:9pt;">
            <li>In The Fly, Stathis threatens to send Veronica's teleportation
              story to OMNI -- his own publication, PARTICLE magazine, created
              for the film, is a clear nod to OMNI. </li>
            <li>In the 1989 romantic film Say Anything, Diane Court has an issue
              in her bedroom next to her desk. There is also an issue visible
              in the garbage can in the background when James Court is sitting
              in the bathtub after having his credit cards declined. </li>
            <li>In The Breakfast Club Anthony Michael Hall's character (the brain/nerd)
              is wearing an OMNI t-shirt in the last scene of the film. </li>
            <li>In Ghostbusters, the Proton Pack appears on a fictional front
              cover of the magazine. </li>
            <li>In the 1985 movie Real Genius, Kent has an oversized mock-up
              of OMNI on the wall of his lab, with his face adorning the cover. </li>
            <li>In the film 2010: The Year We Make Contact, a future OMNI issue
              appeared in front of Roy Scheider on the beach. In retrospect,
              its appearance with Dr. Floyd has the same impact as the appearance
              of Pan-Am on the side of the orbital spaceplane seen in 2001 -
              a once great name that dies before the date in which the film is
              set. </li>
            <li>In Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home, a fellow passenger can be seen
              reading OMNI magazine on the bus that Kirk and Spock take across
              the Golden Gate Bridge. </li>
            <li>On the 2005 album Robot Hive/Exodus by the band Clutch, the song "Mice
              and Gods" references OMNI Magazine in the very first line of the
              song. </li>
            <li>In the film Jurassic Park, Tim Murphy mentions having read an
              article by Alan Grant in Omni magazine. </li>
            <li>In The X-Files episode Fallen Angel, fellow UFO enthusiast Max
              Fenig informs Agent Mulder that he has read Mulder's articles in
              OMNI under the pen name 'M.F. Luder' â€” an anagram for 'F. Mulder'. </li>
            <li>In Sabrina the Teenage Witch (TV series), Zelda briefly mentions
              OMNI Magazine. </li>

            Mail website. </p>
