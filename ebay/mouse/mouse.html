          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">This is a used
              Logitech TrackMan Marble FX with PS2 connector, model number T-CJ12
              / part number 804251-0000. Clean condition from non-smoking environment.
              No drivers are included with this auction, but can be downloaded
              for free from the Logitech website.</font> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">It is a classic
              / funky design with many devoted fans due to its ergonomic design
              and was much lamented when Logitech stopped manufacture. The large
              tracker-ball is able to pop out of the socket entirely for cleaning
              purposes. The ball rotates on small ball bearings inside the socket.
              This has only had one careful owner as I bought this a few years
              ago to use with laptops but have rarely used it.</font></p>
          <p>An extract from Logitech's marketing: <blockquote><span style="font-size: smaller;	color: #0000FF;	font-style: italic;">Place your hand on TrackMan
            Marble FX and you'll feel the Marble difference. This is the only
            finger-operated trackball that lets you move the ball with just your
            finger, or use your finger and thumb for fine detail work. Logitech
            patented Marble sensing technology replaces all the mechanical moving
            parts that record motion with an optical tracking system. A laser-like
            beam illuminates dots printed on the ball, while a sensor tracks
            the motion. This gives you precision, reduces wear, and ensures smooth
            tracking even if the ball gets dirty or scratched. Only TrackMan
            Marble FX offers you this combination of high performance, low maintenance,
            and reliability.</span></blockquote>
            I have included
              detailed photographs so you can judge its good quality and condition for yourself. Please contact me

          <h2>Postage</h2>
          <p>By default, for the UK I will send by the most appropriate second
            class post with a certificate of posting. Internationally I will
            send by Royal Mail surface mail unless airmail is the same price
            or cheaper. Guidance as to delivery time is available on the Royal
            Mail website. </p>
          <p>Whenever possible I re-use packaging materials and re-cycle plastic
            or paper to help pad the package where necessary. Any package will
            be well wrapped and secure following Royal Mail and eBay guidance.</p>
          <p>I will keep the certificate of posting for more than two months
            after despatch.</p>

<h2>Refunds</h2>
<p>If an item is damaged or lost during transit then I will pursue a claim for compensation with the postal service and pay the buyer this compensation when the claim is successful. Time limits apply for Royal Mail compensation, details on their website. Photographs of any damage to packaging would be helpful during the claims process. Note that the standard certificate of posting limits compensation to £36, additional insurance should be taken out for items over this value.

<p>For items sold for over £20, I will offer refunds if the item is not as described or non-functional. The buyer should contact me within 7 days of receipt and return the item to me at their cost and email evidence of posting (unless agreed otherwise). Any refund will exclude return postage costs.

<p>If the description of the item is confusing or unclear please do not hesitate to contact me before you bid. This is a personal sale and I always try to describe the item as clearly as possible to avoid any surprizes for the buyer.
