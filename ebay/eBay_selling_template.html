          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">For sale are
              these unusual wooden hand carved and painted tiny multi-coloured
              elephants from Kandy in Sri Lanka. During the festival in Kandy,
              elephants are decorated in this highly colourful style.</font> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">These elephants
              are about the size of a 1p piece (see photo) and so small enough
              to be used as earrings or to hang on a bracelet or necklace.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">I have included
              detailed photographs and product turntable below so you can judge
              their good quality and condition for yourself. Please contact me
              for any clarifications. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">After the photographs
              were taken I found another elephant that had managed to escape.
              Hence there are actually 11 for sale and 10 in the photographs.
              There are 2 blue, 2 pink, 2 red, 2 green, 2 yellow and 1 lonely
              white one.</font></p></td>

          clarifications will be added to the page listing.</p>
          <h2>Postage</h2>
          <p>By default, for the UK I will send by the most appropriate second
            class post with a certificate of posting. Internationally I will
            send by Royal Mail surface mail unless airmail is the same price
            or cheaper. Guidance as to delivery time is available on the Royal
            Mail website. </p>
          <p>Whenever possible I re-use packaging materials and re-cycle plastic
            or paper to help pad the package where necessary. Any package will
            be well wrapped and secure following Royal Mail and eBay guidance.</p>
          <p>I will keep the certificate of posting for more than two months
            after despatch. Please ask if you would like me to email you a scanned
            copy of the certificate.</p>
          <h2>Payment</h2>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">In the rare event
              that I have not received payment within 3 working days after auction
              end, I will have to assume that the winner is not interested
              and may relist for re-auction.</font> To win this auction you must
              be prepared to make a Paypal payment.</p>
          <p>If there are any problems after auction end, please contact me immediately.

          </dl></blockquote>
          
<h2>Refunds</h2>
<p>If an item is damaged or believed lost during transit, then I will pursue
  a claim for compensation with the postal service and pay the buyer this compensation
  when the claim is successful. Time limits apply for Royal Mail compensation,
  details on their website. Photographs of any damage to packaging would be helpful
  during the claims process. Note that the standard certificate of posting limits
  compensation to £36; additional insurance should be taken out for items over
  this value.
<p>For items sold for over £20, I will offer refunds if the item is
  not as described or arrives non-functional. The buyer should contact me within
  7 days of receipt and return the item to me at their cost and email evidence
  of posting (unless agreed otherwise). Any refund will exclude return postage
  costs and be contingent on recieving the item back for inspection.
<p>For items under £20 please contact me to see if we can reach an accomodation.
  I am obviously cautious of fraudulent claims but credible claims for refund
  and in particular when I am demonstrably at fault will be honoured.
<p><em>If the description of the item is confusing or unclear please do not hesitate
    to contact me before you bid. This is a personal sale and I always try to
    describe the item as clearly as possible to avoid any surprizes for the buyer.</em>
<h2>My service quality commitment</h2>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">As this is a
              personal sale I will do my best to sort out any problems myself

              and sticking to honest descriptions and photographs for my sale
