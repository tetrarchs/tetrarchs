        <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The alien virus arrived on Earth just after World War II - and the world was never the same. For those who become infected, there are two results: death, or transformation. And depending on the recipient, death is sometimes the preferable outcome. Only a few lucky ones become super-human "aces" as a side effect of the virus; the rest are turned into horrible, grotesque "jokers." It's a strange and wonderful, terrible and terrifying world where anything can go. A world that, in a twist of fate, could lie just outside your door. A world of Wild Cards.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Volume Three - Jokers Wild</font>
        <p><a href="http://www.romanempire.talktalk.net/ebay/wc3.jpg" target="_blank"> <img src="http://www.romanempire.talktalk.net/ebay/wc3.jpg" width="100" alt="photo2 extended" border="6" align="left"/> </a> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">With this third volume, the regular Wild Cards approach of individual stories of the previous books is dispensed with in place of a regular, flowing narrative style and is the first true 'mosaic' novel of the series. It's still written by assorted creators but the chapter headings merely specify the time and the only indication of who wrote what is a brief credits page at the end.

With the Swarm taken care of, Jokers Wild continues one of the plot threads of that volume as the Astronomer plans his revenge on the aces who foiled him during that meleé. The whole story takes place over 25 hours and begins at 6am on September 15 1986 - the fortieth anniversary of Wild Card Day - and finishes up at around 7am the next morning.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Volume Five - Down &amp; Dirty</font></p>
        <p><a href="http://www.romanempire.talktalk.net/ebay/wc5.jpg" target="_blank"> <img src="http://www.romanempire.talktalk.net/ebay/wc5.jpg" width="100" alt="5" border="6" align="left" /> </a><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">There are a total of THREE interlinking narratives running through this one; All The King's Horses (by George R.R. Martin) relates the Turtle's crisis of conscience in regards to life as the Turtle; Concerto for Siren & Seratonin (by Roger Zelazny) chronicles Croyd Crenson's life through two transformations; and, from the second section onwards, there is Blood Ties (by Melinda M. Snodgrass) which concerns Tachyon's efforts to deal with a) his grandson, Blaise, b) a gang war on the streets of Jokertown, and c) Croyd Crenson running amok.</font></p>

            <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The highlights of this one include Zelazny's Ashes to Ashes which
            may be the funniest story in the series. We get a deeper insight
            into Croyd Crenson's personality as he constantly bemoans his lack
            of algebra knowledge (a running joke throughout the series) while
            the body he's been sent to retrieve crumbles around him. Williams'
            Unto the Sixth Generation is also top-notch and answers the question
            of how to make the character of an android more interesting than
            some of the flesh-and-blood players, whilst also containing the book's
            major setpiece - aces versus the Swarm. </font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Volume Four - Aces Abroad</font></p>
        <p><a href="http://www.romanempire.talktalk.net/ebay/wc4.jpg" target="_blank"> <img src="http://www.romanempire.talktalk.net/ebay/wc4.jpg" width="100" alt="photo2 extended" border="6" align="left"/></a><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">After the exciting conclusion to the first trilogy, volume four begins the new triad in the now regular Wild Cards format of individual stories with an interlinking narrative. This time, our guide throughout the book is the mayor of Jokertown, Xavier Desmond (written by George R.R. Martin), who is part of a delegation of aces, jokers and politicians on a World Health Organisation sponsored fact-finding tour to see the effects of the virus in other countries.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Volume Six - Ace in the
            Hole</font></p>
        <p><a href="http://www.romanempire.talktalk.net/ebay/wc6.jpg" target="_blank"> <img src="http://www.romanempire.talktalk.net/ebay/wc6.jpg" width="100" alt="photo2 extended" border="6" align="left" /></a><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Our old friend, James Spector sets things in motion early on Monday morning when he visits a warehouse in Jokertown and accepts a contract on a target at the Omni Convention Centre. On the plane, he unwittingly brushes against another player in the unfolding drama, Mackie Messer, who's also off to Atlanta to prove himself worthy in front of his new master.

Meanwhile, as the Hartmann camp reaches the final stages in its campaign, Gregg is finding that something is holding him back from his full potential, but realises the source of his problems when he hears from an old enemy who's close at hand. Meanwhile, Tachyon, who is lending his support to Hartmann whilst fighting a losing battle to teach his grandson the fundamentals of responsibility, gets some unwelcome news from an old comrade that there is a secret ace hidden amongst the candidates, and begins a journey to discover the truth behind the claims.<br/>

Washington Post reporter, Sara Morgenstern is also in town to not only cover the convention, but to expose this secret ace before he can do further harm, and it's not long before she's teaming up with Tachyon and an associate named George Steele in order to achieve her goal.

And with the ghosts of The Four Aces and Argentina ever-present in the background, Jack Braun is busy fighting the good fight for Hartmann's campaign team and discovering he has a gift for political maneuvering he never knew existed. Unfortunately, his political skills are less useful than his physical ones as the two killer aces get closer to their prospective targets with only himself standing in the way.<br />

Against this backdrop, reunions with old friends take place, deals with enemies are made, and assassination plans are acted upon, as all the characters and plot strands converge on the podium in the main hall on Sunday night where the nominee for the next President of the United States will present himself to his adoring fans. </font></p>
