          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Personal sale
              of a new and unused printer cable.</font> This is a USB male to
              DB-25 female connector that is most often used to connect non-USB
              compatible printers to modern PCs or laptops that are not made
              with a DB-25 port. I have my old HP Laserjet 1100 printer connected
              up using another one of these cables making it a useful second
              printer.</p>
          <p>This comes with a driver CD, though in my case Windows Vista didn't
            need any drivers installed in order to recognize my printer was connected.</p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">I have included
              detailed photographs  so you can judge
              good quality and condition for yourself. Please contact me
              for any clarifications. </font></p>

          <h2>Postage</h2>
          <p>By default, for the UK I will send by the most appropriate second
            class post with a certificate of posting. Internationally I will
            send by Royal Mail surface mail unless airmail is the same price
            or cheaper. Guidance as to delivery time is available on the Royal
            Mail website. </p>
          <p>Whenever possible I re-use packaging materials and re-cycle plastic
            or paper to help pad the package where necessary. Any package will
            be well wrapped and secure following Royal Mail and eBay guidance.</p>
          <p>I will keep the certificate of posting for more than two months
            after despatch.</p>
          <h2>Payment</h2>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">In the rare event
              that I have not received payment within 3 working days after auction
              end, I will be forced to assume that the action winner is not interested
              and may relist for re-auction.</font> To win this auction you must
