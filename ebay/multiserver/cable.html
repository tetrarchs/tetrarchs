          <h3><font face="Arial">Description</font></h3>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">For sale is a
              cable used for unlocking K750 / W800 type mobile phones.</font> This
              is the type that does not need power but just connects your computer
              to the phone and the USB port should be recognized if you have
              the right sort of software.</p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">I used
              the cable to unlock my own K750i (using software from totalmultiserver.com)
              and then reprogrammed it with a W800i firmware image that I downloaded
              using eMule (as the only hardware difference between the K750 and
              W800 was styling).</font> I
              shopped around for the cheapest site to give me an unlocking code
              (in fact I bought the unlocking code in an eBay auction which went
              via a site in the USA) and suggest you do the same. Considering
              that you might be charged £30 or so to unlock each phone it can
              be a pretty good saving.</p>
          <p>Using this cable takes a bit of research, so please don't bid on
            this unless you are prepared to take this on as a minor technical
            project or have unlocked phones yourself before<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">.</font></p>

            <h3>Postage</h3>
            <p>By default, for the UK I will send by the most appropriate second
              class post with a certificate of posting. Internationally I will
              send by Royal Mail surface mail unless airmail is the same price
              or cheaper. Guidance as to delivery time is available on the Royal
              Mail website. </p>
            <p>Whenever possible I reuse packaging materials and recycle plastic
              or paper to help pad the package where necessary. Any package will
              be well wrapped and secure following Royal Mail and eBay guidance.</p>
            <p>I will keep the certificate of posting for more than two months
              after despatch. Please ask if you would like me to email you a
              scanned copy of the certificate.</p>
            <h3>Payment</h3>
            <p>In the rare
                event that I have not received payment within 3 working days
                after auction end, I will have to assume that the winner is not
                interested and may relist for re-auction. To win this
            auction you must be prepared to make a Paypal payment.</p>
            <p>If there are any problems after auction end, please contact me
              immediately. You may find <a href="http://pages.ebay.co.uk/help/pay/payingforitems.html" target="_blank">Paying
              For Items</a> a helpful eBay guide.</p>

            <h3>Refunds</h3>
            <p>By using Paypal as your method of payment you can make a claim
              or file a dispute using their service (within 45 days), however
              this is a lengthy and unfortunately complex process (see eBay's
              guidance <a href="http://pages.ebay.co.uk/help/buy/protecting.html" target="_blank">here</a>).
              As a personal seller I am keen to have a happy and satisfactory
              transaction and if you believe the item was not described properly
              or are in any other way unhappy with the transaction, please contact
              me before leaving negative feedback or filing a dispute. I will
              do my best to reach an agreement that you will be happy with.</p>
            <p>If an item is <em><strong>damaged or believed lost during transit</strong></em>,
              then I will pursue a claim for compensation with the postal service
              and pay the buyer this compensation when the claim is successful.
              Time limits apply for Royal Mail compensation, details on their
              website. Photographs of any damage to packaging would be helpful
              during the claims process. Note that the standard<em><strong> certificate
              of posting</strong></em> <em> <strong>limits compensation to £36</strong></em>.
              Additional insurance may be taken out for items over this value
              (only available from Royal Mail when using &quot;signed-for&quot;).
            <p> I am
              cautious of fraudulent claims but credible claims for refund and
              in particular when I am demonstrably at fault will be honoured.
            <p><em>If the description of the item is confusing or unclear please
                do not hesitate to contact me before you bid. This is a personal
                sale and I always try to describe the item as clearly as possible
                to avoid any surprises for the buyer.</em>
