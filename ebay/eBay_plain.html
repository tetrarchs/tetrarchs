                                  <h3>Postage</h3>
                                  <p>By default, for the UK I will send by the most appropriate second
            class post with a certificate of posting. Internationally I will
            send by Royal Mail surface mail unless airmail is the same price
            or cheaper. Guidance as to delivery time is available on the Royal
            Mail website. </p>
          <p>Whenever possible I reuse packaging materials and recycle plastic
            or paper to help pad the package where necessary. Any package will
            be well wrapped and secure following Royal Mail and eBay guidance.</p>
          <p>I will keep the certificate of posting for more than two months
            after despatch. Please ask if you would like me to email you a scanned
            copy of the certificate.</p>

          <h3>Payment</h3>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">In the rare event
              that I have not received payment within 3 working days after auction
              end, I will have to assume that the winner is not interested
              and may relist for re-auction.</font> To win this auction you must
              be prepared to make a Paypal payment.</p>

          <h3>Refunds</h3>

<p>By using Paypal as your method of payment you can make a claim or file a dispute
  using their service (within 45 days), however this is a lengthy and unfortunately
  complex process (see eBay's guidance <a href="http://pages.ebay.co.uk/help/buy/protecting.html" target="_blank">here</a>).
  As a personal seller I am keen to have a happy and satisfactory transaction
  and if you believe the item was not described properly or are in any other
  way unhappy with the transaction, please contact me before leaving negative
  feedback or filing a dispute. I will do my best to reach an agreement that
  you will be happy with.</p>

            <p>If an item is <em><strong>damaged or believed lost during
                transit</strong></em>, then I
              will pursue a claim for compensation with the postal service and
              pay the buyer this compensation when the claim is successful. Time
              limits apply for Royal Mail compensation, details on their website.
              Photographs of any damage to packaging would be helpful during
              the claims process. Note that the standard<em><strong> certificate
              of posting</strong></em>              <em>  <strong>limits compensation
              to £36</strong></em>. Additional insurance may be taken
              out for items over this value (only available from Royal Mail when
                using &quot;signed-for&quot;).
            <p><strong><em>For items sold for over £20</em></strong>, I will
              offer refunds if the item is not as described in any significant
              way, or arrives non-functional (unless damaged in transit, see
              above). The buyer should contact me within 7 days of receipt and
              return the item to me at their cost and email evidence of posting
              (unless agreed otherwise). Any refund will include reasonable return
              postage costs and be contingent on receiving the item back for
              inspection.
            <p><em><strong>For items under £20</strong></em> please contact me
              to see if we can reach an accommodation, in particular it may not
              be worth the effort or cost of posting the item back to me. I am
              cautious of fraudulent claims but credible claims for refund and
              in particular when I am demonstrably at fault will be honoured.
            <p><em>If the description of the item is confusing or unclear please
                do not hesitate to contact me before you bid. This is a personal
                sale and I always try to describe the item as clearly as possible
                to avoid any surprises for the buyer.</em>
